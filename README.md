# Dynamic-Stock-Recommendation-Machine_Learning

## Introduction:
We introduce a scheme to buy and hold top 20% stocks dynamically that outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&P 500 index.
Overview of Project steps:
+1. Data Processing
+2. Applying five ML algorithms
+3. Choosing the best models with lowest MSE
+4. Test with three portfolio allocation methods

## The proposed scheme:
A. Rolling window based data separation (training-testing-trading):
The training period is from 16 quarters to 40 quarters, followed by a 2-month lag. The testing period is 4-quarter long, followed by another 2-month lag. Finally, the trade period is 1 quarter.

B. Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is obtained from Wharton Research Data Services and is between 1 Jun 1990 and 1 Jun 2017.
We first removed outlier records (about 0.84%). Then the dataset is divided into three periods (to preserve a long-enough out-of-sample period for back-testing). 20 most popular financial ratios are calculated from the raw data. The dataset is also split into 11 GICS sectors. Finally, missing data (around 7%) are removed from the dataset.

## Methodology:
Linear Machine learning methods:
+1. Linear Regression
+2. Forward stepwise linear regression
+3. Regularized ridge linear regression

Non-linear machine learning methods: 
A. Random Forest
B. Generalized Boosted Regression model (GBM)
Implemented in ml_model.py








##Implementation: 
Step 1. Train and test the model to get the MSE for each of the five models. 
Step 2. Choose the model that has the lowest MSE in that certain period.
Step 3. Use the predicted return in the selected model to pick up top 20% stocks from each sector.
Step 4. We check on the models features and its coefficients or importance level to ensure that there are no abnormal results.

## Portfolio allocation:
As for the portfolio allocation, we use mean-variance and minimum-variance constraints to allocate the stocks we chose before appropriately. (fundamental_portfolio.ipynb)

## Abstract:
Stock recommendation is vital to investment companies and investors. However, no single stock selection strategy will always win while analysts may not have enough time to check all S&P 500 stocks (the Standard & Poor’s 500). In this paper, we propose a practical scheme that recommends stocks from S&P 500 using machine learning. Our basic idea is to buy and hold the top 20% stocks dynamically. First, we select representative stock indicators with good explanatory power. Secondly, we take five frequently used machine learning methods, including linear regression, ridge regression, stepwise regression, random forest and generalized boosted regression, to model stock indicators and quarterly log-return in a rolling window. Thirdly, we choose the model with the lowest Mean Square Error in each period to rank stocks. Finally, we test the selected stocks by conducting portfolio allocation methods such as equally weighted, mean- variance, and minimum-variance. Our empirical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the long-only strategy on the S&P 500 index in terms of Sharpe ratio and cumulative returns.

## Index Term:
Stock recommendation, fundamental value investing, machine learning, model selection, risk management

## Project summary：
+ We developed a practical approach to using machine-learning methods selecting S&P 500 stocks based on financial ratios (e.g., EPS, ROA, ROE, etc). Outperformed the S&P 500 index on out of sample data, achieved a Sharpe ratio of 0.5 (0.19 on SPX).
+ We performed feature selection by 11 GICS sectors based on a rolling window to choose the lowest MSE model among Linear Regression, Stepwise Regression, Regression with Ridge, Random Forest, and GBM. Applied a model ensemble method.
